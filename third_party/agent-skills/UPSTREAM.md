# Bundled agent-skill provenance

Snapshot: 2026-08-07. This inventory covers source copied into
`.agents/skills`; package-manager dependencies are outside its scope.
`skills-lock.json` records installer-managed bundles. Manually curated bundles
such as `better-result`, `effect`, and `motion` are recorded here and in their
bundled source or skill guidance instead.

The files are development instructions, not application runtime code. Local
changes are licensed with Garden, while upstream portions remain under the
licenses named below. Each retained upstream license is bundled beside this
file under a directory named for its repository.

## Removed bundles

The OSS preparation removed copied bundles whose exact source did not grant a
redistribution license, or whose generated provenance could not be established:

- `better-auth-best-practices`, `organization-best-practices`, and
  `two-factor-authentication-best-practices`: `better-auth/skills` has no
  repository license as of the snapshot date.
- `tanstack-integration-best-practices`, `tanstack-query-best-practices`,
  `tanstack-router-best-practices`, and `tanstack-start-best-practices`:
  `DeckardGer/tanstack-agent-skills` has no repository license as of the
  snapshot date.
- `bro`: `backnotprop/bro` has no repository license as of the snapshot date.
- `integration-tanstack-start`: the files identify PostHog as author, but the
  exact generated source path and source snapshot were not recoverable.
- `teach-impeccable`: its immediate source was the author's old aggregate
  skill repository, which did not record the original upstream or a license.

Those skills may still be installed locally by contributors directly from
their owners. Garden does not redistribute their source.
