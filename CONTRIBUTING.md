# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Garden.

## Development

Follow the [developer onboarding guide](docs/development/onboarding.md) for a
complete local setup and system walkthrough. The shorter setup path remains in
[README.md](README.md#run-garden-locally).

Run the checks relevant to your change. The full test suite starts Postgres 16
through Testcontainers, so Docker must be running. Before opening a pull
request, run the same main checks as CI:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Keep pull requests focused. Include tests for behavior changes, update shared
schemas before their consumers, and never commit credentials or local resource
overlays.

## Connectors

Connector changes follow the policy in [docs/core/connectors.md](docs/core/connectors.md).

Before opening a PR:

- Run `pnpm verify:connectors`.
- Run `pnpm --filter @garden/connectors typecheck`.
- Run `pnpm --filter @garden/connectors test`.
- Follow the documented Executor-hosted or Garden-native contribution path;
  there is no connector scaffolding command.
- Check the review checklist in [docs/core/connectors.md](docs/core/connectors.md#review-checklist).
