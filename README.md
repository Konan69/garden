# Garden

An operating system where humans and AI agents work side by side.

You sign up, get a persistent personal agent, connect your tools (Gmail, Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, search), and your agent starts picking up work — drafting emails, triaging issues, writing summaries, running reports. You stay in the loop through a single tabbed workspace: inbox, issues, chat, agent config, and skills all open as tabs in one surface.

> **Raise the floor, don't lower the ceiling.** Non-technical users get a product that just works. Power users get the full capability surface. Nothing is dumbed down.

---

## Why Garden

AI models are extraordinary. The harness around them is broken.

Power users build elaborate personal setups — MCP servers, custom prompts, CLI tools, scheduled scripts — and get 10x. Everyone else watches and asks how. Training doesn't fix it. Workshops don't fix it. Workflows discovered by one person stay with that person.

Garden fixes this. Inspired by [Ramp's Glass](https://x.com/sebgoddijn/status/2042285915435937816) (99% internal adoption, built for every function — finance, ops, marketing, not just eng), we're building the product version of that system. Every employee gets an AI-powered operating surface. One person's breakthrough becomes everyone's baseline.

### Who it's for

**Primary:** Non-technical roles at small-to-mid companies (10–500 employees) — CEOs, ops, finance, marketing, sales, customer support.

**Secondary:** Developers on the same teams. Garden doesn't replace Claude Code or Cursor — it's where agent-authored PRs come back to, where GitHub issues live alongside human work, and where non-dev teammates operate.

## Core concepts

### Your agent — a digital twin

Every user gets a persistent personal agent created at signup. It knows your tools, your context, your active work, and your preferences. It acts as a paired coworker — not a chatbot, not a fleet you manage.

Your agent can delegate to specialists for bounded work, but the primary experience is you and your agent working together.

### Skills — reusable capability modules

Garden adopts the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io) from Anthropic (used by Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, and ~30 others). A skill is a `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter + markdown) plus optional bundled files. Skills are workspace-scoped, Postgres-versioned, and edited in-app.

When one user writes a great skill, every agent in the workspace can use it.

### Connections & permissions

Connections today include **Gmail**, **Google Drive**, **Slack**, **GitHub**, and **Discord**. Exa powers Garden's first-party web-search tool rather than masquerading as a user connection. Connector tools have per-agent permissions at three trust levels:

- **Ask always** — agent asks before every action
- **Ask on risky** — agent proceeds on reads, asks on writes/sends
- **Never ask** — full autonomy for trusted, high-volume operations

When an agent needs approval, it posts to your inbox. Approve, and optionally upgrade trust for next time.

### The tabbed workspace

Everything is a tab — inbox, issue detail, chat session, agent config, skill editor, settings. No page switching, no mode confusion. Tabs persist across reloads, hidden tabs keep React state alive.

FlexLayout tab styling notes live in [docs/core/flexlayout-tabs.md](docs/core/flexlayout-tabs.md).

A Glass-style two-level sidebar on the left: icon rail for context switching (`HOME`, `CHATS`, `AGENT`, `SKILLS`, `CONNECTIONS`, `SETTINGS`) and a collapsible explorer panel beside it.

### Why Cloudflare

- **Hibernation economics.** Durable Objects cost zero when idle. A persistent agent per user is economically viable — 100M agents at modest concurrency is ~100 active instances, not millions of containers.
- **One stack.** Agents (DOs + SDK), code execution (Sandboxes), frontend (Pages/Workers), storage (R2). No stitching Modal + E2B + Vercel + Supabase + a queue.
- **Actor model fits agents.** Per-agent SQLite means each agent's memory and state lives with it. No shared DB for agent state, no distributed locks, no job queue.
- **All GA.** Sandboxes, DOs, Agents SDK — shipped and production-ready.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v22.12+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (v10.33.0)
- A Postgres database ([Neon](https://neon.tech) recommended)
- A Cloudflare account and Wrangler auth for Workers AI during local development
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine only for remote infrastructure with Sandbox containers

### Setup

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Flow-Research/garden.git && cd garden

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Authenticate the Workers AI binding used in local development
pnpm --filter @garden/web exec wrangler login

# Configure local environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit root .env with this repo's shared local development values:
#   CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<your Cloudflare account>
#   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
#   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<generate a random secret>
#   EXECUTOR_SECRET_KEY=<generate a persistent random secret>
#   BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
#   ENVIRONMENT=development
#
#   Optional:
#   AI_GATEWAY_ID for routing Workers AI through your own AI Gateway
#   RESEND_API_KEY for transactional email
#   GitHub / Google / Slack / Discord keys for those connectors
#   EXA_API_KEY for web search
#
# The app should not boot cleanly without the required values.
# Web, database tooling, and local scripts all read root .env.
# Deployed Workers continue to use Cloudflare secrets and bindings.

# Run database migrations
pnpm --filter @garden/db db:migrate

# Start Garden locally through Turbo's TUI
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

`pnpm dev` is the reproducible local workflow:

- Turbo starts `@garden/web` in TUI mode.
- The web app runs on `localhost:3000`.
- D1, R2, Durable Objects, and Workflows run in the local Workers simulator.
- Hyperdrive connects to `DATABASE_URL` from root `.env`.
- Workers AI uses Cloudflare's remote binding and may incur account usage.

`pnpm dev:remote` enables Cloudflare remote bindings and Sandbox containers. It
requires Docker, Wrangler authentication, and ignored
`apps/web/wrangler.containers.local.jsonc` with real Hyperdrive and D1 resource
IDs. Copy `apps/web/wrangler.containers.jsonc` to that path before editing it;
never commit account-specific IDs.

OAuth callbacks are configured for `localhost:3000` in local env and Wrangler config.

## Operating principles

1. **Don't limit anyone's upside.** Non-tech users get rails, but the rails carry them to the same ceiling. No "basic" vs "advanced" mode. One product.
2. **One person's breakthrough becomes everyone's baseline.** Skills, memory, and agent configs compound across the workspace.
3. **The product is the enablement.** No training workshops. The product teaches by doing — suggesting skills at the right moment, surfacing successful patterns, self-healing connector errors.

---

## MVP scope

**In scope:** Multi-user workspaces, personal agent per user, agent delegation, generic issue primitive, Agent Skills spec, Gmail + Google Drive + Slack + GitHub + search connectors, tabbed workspace surface, per-agent permissions, live agent activity streaming, basic audit log.

**Out of scope:** Knowledge graph, skill marketplace, native desktop/mobile apps, enterprise SSO, wide connector catalog. See [`docs/core/DEFERRED.md`](docs/core/DEFERRED.md).
