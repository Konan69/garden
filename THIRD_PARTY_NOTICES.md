# Third-party notices

This file covers source incorporated or regenerated directly in Garden. It is
not yet a complete inventory of every transitive package installed by the
workspace package manager.

## Bundled agent skills

Garden includes a curated set of development-time agent instructions under
`.agents/skills`. Their exact upstream repositories, local treatment, and
primary license evidence are recorded in
`third_party/agent-skills/UPSTREAM.md`. Complete upstream license files are
bundled under `third_party/agent-skills/`.

Copies without a verifiable redistribution grant were removed during OSS
preparation. These instructions are not part of Garden's application runtime.

## Cloudflare OS Workspace Docs

Garden incorporates Cloudflare OS's embedded Workspace Docs browser client and
server authority. The extracted sources are retained byte-identically at
`third_party/cloudflare-os/workspace-docs/client.js` and
`third_party/cloudflare-os/workspace-docs/server.js`. Reference:
`cloudflare/cloudflare-os`, file
`packages/workshop-backend/format-blueprints/workspace-docs.gadget`, commit
`f0517773aa6a2f6fbb1281ddbadcca3cb6fd2992`.

Cloudflare OS is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. The complete
upstream license is included at `third_party/cloudflare-os/LICENSE`.

Garden's integration is modified: the upstream client runs in an isolated
iframe; an external adapter maps its Gadget RPC vocabulary onto authenticated
Effect HttpApi GET/POST/SSE routes; Effect Schema defines the contracts;
`SynchronizedRef.modifyEffect` serializes Durable Object storage transitions;
operation ids are deduplicated; and DOCX ingestion uses Cloudflare Workers AI
`toMarkdown` plus structural HTML sanitization, matching Cloudflare OS's own
document-conversion boundary. The typed `server-authority.ts` adaptation mechanically
retains upstream `setDocumentLocked`/`applyOperationLocked` mutation behavior
while composing it into Garden's existing per-thread Durable Object instead of
introducing the gadget's second Durable Object.

## Cloudflare Agents

Garden carries `patches/agents@0.17.3.patch`, which modifies Cloudflare Agents
distribution files used by the MCP session runtime. The patch changes replay,
delivery acknowledgement, Durable Object storage handling, SSE rotation, and
priming-event behavior.

Upstream: https://github.com/cloudflare/agents

The upstream MIT license, NOTICE, and third-party license inventory are
included unchanged under `third_party/cloudflare-agents/`.

## Executor

Garden uses Executor v1.5.40 from upstream commit
`b029643641832ef5f9b0d4ff263d96e1a5b2739c`. The public SDK and plugins are
normal package dependencies. Exact upstream source retained under
`third_party/executor` supplies only unpublished Cloudflare MCP/Durable Object,
dynamic-runtime, encrypted-secret, toolkit, and preset surfaces. Garden's
documented changes adapt those sources to one in-process Worker runtime and
bound result envelopes.

## Cabinet Grotesk font

Garden vendors one Cabinet Grotesk woff2 (weight 700) at
`packages/ui/fonts/cabinet-grotesk/cabinet-grotesk-700.woff2`, downloaded from
the Fontshare CDN (Indian Type Foundry). Cabinet Grotesk is not published to
npm or Google Fonts, and the design system only uses the bold weight for
display titles.

use). Source and license details:
`packages/ui/fonts/cabinet-grotesk/LICENSE.txt`.

## shadcn/ui

Garden's files under `packages/ui/components/ui` and
`packages/ui/hooks/use-mobile.ts` were regenerated from the official shadcn/ui
registry and then adapted to Garden's package boundaries.
