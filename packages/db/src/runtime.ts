/**
 * Returns a Drizzle client for a Hyperdrive connection string. Callers MUST pass
 * `env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString`, never the raw Neon `DATABASE_URL`.
 *
 * Why this exists: the agent runtime previously called `drizzle(env.DATABASE_URL)`
 * from `drizzle-orm/neon-serverless` on every operation — a brand-new Neon
 * WebSocket connection per call, straight to the origin, bypassing Hyperdrive and
 * never closed. Those orphaned direct connections defeat database autosuspend
 * and keep origin compute active without useful work.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT cache/pool connections here. Pooling and closing idle
 * origin connections is Hyperdrive's job (10-minute idle timeout —
 * https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/platform/limits/), so once traffic
 * goes through the Hyperdrive binding, Neon can scale to zero again. App-side
 * connection caching across invocations is also a Cloudflare anti-pattern: I/O
 * created in one request cannot be reused by another ("Cannot perform I/O on behalf
 * of a different request" — https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/errors/).
 * node-postgres' connection-string form creates an invocation-local pool that
 * Hyperdrive fronts; we let the driver and Hyperdrive own the lifecycle.
 *
 * TODO(effect): rewrite the runtime DB layer with Effect. Connection lifecycle
 * here is implicit (we lean on Hyperdrive + the driver to reap). Effect `Scope` /
 * `acquireRelease` would make acquire/close explicit and leak-proof across the
 * agent-runtime call sites, and compose with the rest of the better-result →
 * Effect migration.
